# About
Examples are taken from [RabbitMQ tutorials](https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/) page (PHP version). The main difference is that they are prepared in docker containers. Those samples are not exactly as they are shown in original tutorials but they are altered to make them more interesting (at least in my view). In each example (directory) there are seperate readme instruction to follow. There is no need to follow examples in order, you can jump to any one straight away because each one of it is self-explanatory.

If you want to suggest something or you see a bug then please create an issue. PR's welcome.

Have fun.
